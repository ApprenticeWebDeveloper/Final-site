        <p>
           Destine is VRGL Studios original modpack: a difficult but fun survival experience with difficult bosses, <br>
            new structures, and many weapons.This modpack is designed to make the game as content rich as possible <br>
            while mantaining a challenging experience. Get ready to adventure through new biomes, fight new enemies, <br>
            and uncover secret hidden content. We aimed for this to play vaguely like a soulsborne but mainly like an <br>
            exploration and mystery game with tons of PVE and PVP. You can join this server by using the usual ip and <br>
            this server will be online the most. We created the modpack however we credit all the original mod creators <br>
            for making the content that makes this server amazing. We couldent do aything without all the forge modders <br>
            and creators. After downloading the zip file simply upload it into forge ad see all the mods and authors/creators.
